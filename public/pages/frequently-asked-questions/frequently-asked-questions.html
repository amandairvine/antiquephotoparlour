            </div>
            <h1>Once you've chosen a theme and we bring you into our studio's dressing area, your sitting will begin!
            </h1>
            <h2>1. Clothing Selection</h2>

            <p>We will show options for clothing based off of the theme that you chose.</p>
            <p>Depending on the outfit you choose and the clothing that you are wearing when you visit us, we may
                require you to change using one of our two curtained-off changing rooms.</p>

            <div class="item-note">
                <p class="note"><span>Note:</span> Although not required, we recommend wearing similar
                    attire to the following for the smoothest experience:</p>
                <p class="note note-section"><span>Ladies:</span> Black or White Tank Top
                    under easily removable layers with Shorts or Leggings.</p>
                <p class="note note-section"><span>Gentlemen:</span> T-Shirt or Tank Top
                    under easily removable layers with Black Trousers <br>(Either Jeans or Dress Pants - if there
                    are
                    logos/designs/side pockets or they are differently coloured, we will provide Black Pants for
                    you)
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Once you’ve checked out your outfit and everyone in your group is happy with how they look, we’ll
                bring you to our set for your photos!</p>
            <div class="item-note">
                <p class="note"><span class="note-header">Note:</span> We provide bins for you to store your items in,
                    such as bags, purses, jackets, sweaters, shoes, etc. Those bins will stay with your group while you
                    take your photos so you can keep an eye on them!</p>
            </div>

            <h2>2. Photography</h2>

            <p>We’ll set the scene to match your chosen theme, including posing!</p>
            <div class="item-note">
                <p class="note"><span>Note:</span> The size of your group and your chosen outfits will impact
                    posing. Please talk to your photographer about any alternate poses you have in mind, and we’ll
                    decide if we can accommodate or make alternate suggestions. Got a good side? A pose you love or one
                    you don’t? Let us know! We’ll do our best to guide you and shoot in ways that play to your
                    strengths. Our goal is to help you look and feel your best.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Once posed, we'll hand out props for everyone to hold.</p>
            <div class="item-note">
                <p class="note"><span>Note:</span> Our staff reserves the right to deny props to any persons we
                    deem unfit to properly handle our property at any time during a sitting. This includes children of
                    all ages as well as adults! We also have age restrictions on some props, due to weight, size, and
                    risk of injury, such as our replica swords, rifles and pistols. However, we do have many alternate
                    props for your youngsters! Ask us for further details.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Then, the fun begins! Your photographer will instruct you throughout your sitting on expressions,
                where you should look, and fun theme-related activities using your provided props!</p>

            <h2>3. Photo Proofing</h2>

            <p>Once your photo session is completed, you’ll be brought back to the dressing area to return to your
                modern day attire.<br>From there, your group will make their way to our computers so we can go through
                your
                photos with you.</p>
            <p>We’ll help you narrow down your favourite photos and provide suggestions for prints and digital copies!
            </p>
            <p>The Sitting Fee for your group includes one printed 8x10 photo.<br>For additional prints and digital
                copies, see our <span>Pricing</span> page for details.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content-section">
                <p>The length of a sitting depends on many factors, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Number of People</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For example, the average 2 person sitting takes about 30 to 45 minutes, whereas a group
                                of 4 might take up to 45 minutes to 1 hour. Depending on how many people you have in a
                                sitting, dressing, shooting, and proofing can take some time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Chosen Theme</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some themes have clothing options that we can easily put over top of what you are
                                wearing when you come in to the studio, such as Victorian, Dressy Western, and Cowboys &
                                Cowgirls. Other themes may require clothing to be removed, such as Roaring 20's and
                                Showgirls.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Busy Hours</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At peak times, we may have more than one group in the studio. While we do our best to
                                keep things moving smoothly, this can occasionally mean a short wait or a slight delay
                                in your sitting. We appreciate your patience and always make sure every group gets the
                                attention they deserve.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Children</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Little ones can be unpredictable, and we understand that dressing them up sometimes
                                takes extra patience. We’re happy to work with your family’s pace to ensure a positive
                                experience, but please allow a little extra time if your group includes children.</li>

            <p>We’ve been able to fit groups as large as 20 people into a single sitting.
                However, due to the size of our studio, any group larger than 12 people tend to get pretty squished.</p>
            <p>For the best results and the most comfortable experience, we recommend keeping group sizes to 12 people or less. If you have a larger party, we suggest splitting into smaller groups.</p>
            <p>Feel free to contact us regarding larger group sizes and we would be happy to make suggestions.</p>

                                meal-time schedule. A well-rested and fed baby is a happy baby, which helps us capture
