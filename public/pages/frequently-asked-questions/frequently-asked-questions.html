                        <p>Once you've chosen a theme and we bring you into our studio's dressing area, your sitting

                        <p class="note">Note: Although not required, we recommend wearing similar attire to the
                            following for the smoothest experience:<br><br>

                            Gentlemen: T-Shirt or Tank Top under easily removable layers with Black Trousers (either
                            jeans or dress pants - if there are logos/designs/side pockets or differently coloured,
                            we will provide black pants for you)

                        <p>Once you’ve checked out your outfit and everyone in your group is happy with how they look,
                            we’ll bring you to our set for your photos!</p>
                        <p>Note: We provide bins for you to transport your things in, such as bags, purses, jackets,
                            sweaters, shoes, etc. Those bins stay with your group for your whole sitting!</p>
